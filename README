That's it, here are my dotfiles; note that most of the things are very opinionated
(obviously) and subject to breaking changes e.g. I switch the font once every couple
of months, add/remove plugins if those are useful at a given moment or not, etc.

Managing these via GNU Stow (recently knew about it), previously I was copying-pasting
those which was totally pointless and, in consequence, pushing commits ~ once a year
because the process was tedious.

Note that the `.ssh/config` directory just contains the configuration for both GitHub and
the Hugging Face Hub but it's neither included within `stow` nor exposing any public
information, it's just useful if you configure Git over SSH for both of those VCSs.
