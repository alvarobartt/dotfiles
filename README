That's it, here are my dotfiles; note that most of the things are very opinionated
(obviously) and subject to breaking changes e.g. I switch the font once every couple
of months, add/remove plugins if those are useful at a given moment or not, etc.

Managing these via GNU Stow (recently knew about it), previously I was copying-pasting
those which was totally pointless and, in consequence, pushing commits ~ once a year
because the process was tedious.

Note that the .ssh/config file just contains the configuration for both GitHub and
the Hugging Face Hub but it's neither included within stow nor exposing any public
information, it's just useful if you configure Git over SSH for both of those VCSs.

TL;DR You need to have installed git, nvim, LazyVim, tmux, Fish, Kitty, and probably more
things (check scripts/hf-setup.sh for reference as it contains the standard setup workflow
for at least nvim and LazyVim).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alvarobartt/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/
stow fish kitty nvim starship tmux
# optional
stow scripts
```

Ignore both git/ and .ssh/ because those values should only be a reference, as those
contain e.g. my name and email, as well as some absolute paths to my public SSH keys
which may be located elsewhere in your case. Also ignore .github/ as it contains the
trufflehog workflow required to check if any secret has been leaked.
